# Question_Answering
The goal of this project is to get familiar with Question Answering task for me. There will be two ways to implement QA model.

I will first start with going through the process of QA with finetuned BERT model. 

Then, in the second way, I will implement a Bidirectional Attention Flow neural network, which takes inference from Gauthier's implementation.
